			<p><b>Title:</b><br>Software Ecosystems in Industry</p>

			<p><b>Abstract:</b> <br>
			The globalization of the software industry creates business opportunities for organizations that acquire and offer IT products and services in several domains. However, the growing dependency on the networks of suppliers and external developers to reach organizational objectives and to analyze diversified stakeholders' demands brings several challenges. The reason is the fact that the set of technologies and applications – extensible and/or integrated – forms a common technological platform that joins a community of suppliers, external developers and users, generating networks known as software ecosystems (SECO). An important concern refers to SECO modeling and analysis since IT managers should make decisions based on a systemic perspective. In this talk, we aim to introduce some concepts and factors that affect SECO modeling and analysis in industry. In addition, some SECO implications on the applied software engineering & sustainability and diversity will be pointed out.

			<p><b>Title:</b><br>Collaboration or, wait -- diversity at large scale: How inclusive developers can engineer software for diverse end-users</p>

			<p><b>Abstract:</b> <br>
			Software has become ubiquitous and influences our society in all aspects of our lives. The time of developing software for well known and a limited category of users is long gone. Developer collaboration, too, takes place within software ecosystems that leverage open innovation in large scale, multi stakeholder and multi-team and multi-organization projects and for a wide range of end-users. As designers, we have not only the responsibility but an unprecedented opportunity to develop such complex software for, and with diverse end-users. Notwithstanding the diversity crisis in software development, inclusive approaches to software development offer the promise for more inclusive software. In this talk I will foster a discussion of the relationship between the developers together with their interaction and development processes, and the software they develop, as software products reflect the diversity of understanding and experiences of the developing teams. I argue that our focus should be on the inclusiveness in software collaborations, and describe what design approaches, tools and education environments can support diverse collaborating teams becoming more inclusive in order to develop more inclusive software.

			<p><b>Title:</b><br>Towards Data- and AI-Centricity</p>	

			<p><b>Abstract:</b> <br>
				Digitalization, enabled by software, data and artificial intelligence, has a profound impact on industry and society. For systems, systems of systems as well as software ecosystems, the opportunities provided by fast feedback loops with the system in operation through DevOps, the ability to take data-driven decisions as well as the use of machine- and deep-learning are not fully utilized in most contexts. This keynote discusses the trends underlying these developments as well as the implications for systems-of-systems and software ecosystems. Several industrial examples are used to illustrate the key implications discussed in the talk.

			Alexander Serebrenik is a full professor of social software engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands. His research goal is to facilitate evolution of software by taking into account social aspects of software development. His work tends to involve theories and methods both from within computer science (e.g., theory of socio-technical coordination; methods from natural language processing, machine learning) and from outside of computer science (e.g., organisational psychology). The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored a book “Evolving Software Systems” (Springer Verlag, 2014), and more than 170 scientific papers and articles. He is actively involved in organisation of scientific conferences and is member of the editorial board of several journals. He has won multiple best paper and distinguished reviewer awards. Alexander is a senior member of IEEE and a member of ACM. Contact him at <a href="mailto:a.serebrenik@tue.nl" target="_blank">a.serebrenik@tue.nl</a>.
